To perform exploratory data analysis (EDA) on a hotel booking dataset in order to gain insights into customer behavior and booking patterns. The dataset contained information on hotel bookings, including booking dates, customer demographics, and reservation details. First, we cleaned and preprocessed the data, which involved removing missing values, handling duplicates. Then we visualized the data using various graphical techniques such as histograms, scatter plots, and heat maps. Through our analysis, we discovered several interesting insights.
